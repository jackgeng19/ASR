    "text": "So when you are first trying to engage your audience, consider these things. One, what is the most important message I need to communicate? Two, how can I convey it in the shortest possible time, i.e. entice someone to engage? And three, is there a visual alternative that communicates this message in a stronger way? By showing the sky more than the tower, you can see that it is high up and uninterrupted. You immediately process the message of success, luxury, prestige. The image is used to engage and the flyer holds further details. Here the road sign imagery sparks the interest. Once the person is engaged, they see the beer coasters interactive. It highlights how alcohol affects safe driving, which is much better than saying this in a sentence. Could this be any more succinct? Its simplicity completely overrides complexity, debate and brings it back to the most important message. At Street Fighter Media, there are so many benefits that I want to highlight to our potential clients. We have 17 services. We have ground teams in every state. Our campaign reporting is unmatched or maybe that we offer graphic design. But when engaging someone for the first time, the most important message that needs to be communicated is that we connect with the locals in ways that others can't. And I can get into the details later. So how do I convey the strongest possible message in the shortest amount of time? A phrase that we commonly use, avoiding any technical language, is that we defy convention to create unique media spaces in public areas, which is great. But consider this. Visually communicating this message is much stronger and can be processed in a much shorter space of time. It explains exactly what we do without using micro language or alienating a potential client. Once that person has engaged, opportunities open up to go into all of those other marvelous things. So when trying to engage your target, take a step back and consider the strongest possible message in the shortest amount of time. Then take it a step further to see whether your message would be stronger if it were communicated visually."
